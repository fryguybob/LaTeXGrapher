% This can be used as a test case file where each there is a plot file

% Handling of NaN.  This should be drawn as though the function were out of range in Y but
% without adding any arrow heads.  Currently the issue with implementing this is the code
% assumes that you can just choose to not stroke invalid segments.  Really we want to not
% even have segments there.  The plotting should be two separate parts: first determine
% valid ranges where f is continuous and within the Y-view, second plot those ranges doing
% the right thing for the boundries.
% This specific graph should start with a open circle at (-1,1), follow the quadratic to
% (3,9) then have a filled circle.
j(x) = NaN  | x < -1
       x*x  | x <= 3

% Need a way to make this graph prettier
