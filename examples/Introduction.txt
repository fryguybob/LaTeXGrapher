% View is comma separated list of ordered pairs.

% Function definition follows normal rules.
% After a definition a ':' followed by x = ...
% lists the special points for a function.
% Special points are points that cannot
% be plotted with simple function evaulation.
> f(x) = (x - 3)*(x - 2)/(x - 3) : x = 3

% Piecewise function:
% The pattern is for each line we have an equation and a conditional statement.
% At the end we have special points.  The bounds on the piecewise conditions
% are automatically special points.  A blank condition is taken to always
% be true.  The function is evaluated at the first condition that is true.
> g(x) = x     | x < -3
         x - 2 | x < 3

% Helper functions.
% Helpers are on a line starting with '>'.  They get parsed
% like a normal function, but don't get plotted.
> h(t,u) = t*sin(u)
> h'(x) = h(x,pi*x)

% Markup.
% These would be "editable" in a graphical the markup editor.
% to make that easier we might want to ensure that the lanaguage
% kept them as a single line.
